### Project Title

SQL Vendor Sales Analysis

### Description

In this project, I've developed queries from two giftcard vendor datasets (Vendor_1 and Vendor_1_updated) along with a sales dataset. These queries were designed to thoroughly examine the databases and facilitate data comparison to fulfill the client's requirements.

I've focused on answering the following questions: 

* The brand with the highest discount rate in Vendor_1 dataset
* Show the brands, discount rates, and the difference of the discount rates between both vendor datasets
* Show the day, brands, total sales, and the running total of sales ordered by brand name and day from Vendor_1_updated dataset and Sales dataset
* Identify total sales by week and most frequently purchased brand for that week from Vendor_1_updated dataset


Key data analytic skills highlighted in the SQL query project include SQL query writing, data aggregation, data joins, transformation, window functions, and data interpretation.
### Files Used
